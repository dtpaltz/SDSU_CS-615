Home Work 5   MoCities shapefile

    Using MOJO or Arcview, we can turn moCity.txt, a file of cities and
    their geographic coordinates, into an event theme, and then into
    a shapefile.    I then uploaded the .shp and .shx files to rohan
    and we can display their contents using od -x, i.e. an octal dump with
    a hex option.  This will happen in class.

    You will be able to make  copies of those files.   ESRI has a set of white
    papers, one of which deals with the exact formats of their
    shapefiles.   Your first step is to obtain a copy of that white
    paper.     Try esri.com -> library -> whitepapers -> pdfs
    -> shapefile.pdf, which should have the title ESRI Shapefile
    Technical Description.

    You are then to take the hex dumps and show that they correspond
    exactly to what is predicted by the ESRI white paper.   Do at
    least one hand calculation of a double precision number to verify
    that it corresponds correctly to some geographic coordinate in the
    text file.  Do this slowly and carefully after reviewing IEEE
    double precision representation.  Convert hexadecimal numbers to
    decimal, showing your work.   Everything in the shp and shx file must
    be explained.

    A smart thing to do is to triple or quadruple space the shapefiles, so
    you can annotate what is going on, by writing between the lines.

    This is not a team project, so do your OWN work, and categorically refuse
    to let others see it.  You can help someone understand IEEE floating
    point, but NOT using any floating point numbers in the assignment.  You
    can of course ask me for aid.
	
	
	
	
	
from your rohan account, to get correct shapefile type these
cp ~eckberg/spatial/shp2sdo/mocities.shp  mocities.shx
cp ~eckberg/spatial/shp2sdo/mocities.shx  mocities.shx
cp ~eckberg/spatial/shp2sdo/mocities.dbf  mocities.dbf
cp ~eckberg/spatial/shp2sdo/shp2sdo       shp2sdo
