The final demo will include map viewer and java.   In map viewer you need
only display your SDO local coordinates opus (donkey cart in 2015).  You
can do it as a map builder theme preview for partial credit.

On the Java side you are first, to capture the donkey cart rows from your
Oracle SDO table, and redo each one to display it in Java, e.g. tranlate an
Oracle circle to a java circle, and display it with a Java draw method.

After that you are to query your SDO table from Java using more JDBC,
and in this phase, the request is to do 10 topological spatial functions,
e.g. SDO_INTERSECTION.   Oracle will return something to Java, maybe a number
and maybe an SDO_GEOMETRY, and you display the answer from your Java code.
The final bit is to do 2 updates (reduced from 3) to the SDO table, one of
which deletes a row, and one of which adds a row.  And then of course, redraw
the entire picture after each of these changes.

Good java design will make the demo easier.   E.g. a drop down list of
your topological functions, and when you click on one, that query gets sent.
